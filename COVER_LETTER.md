In my current role as Senior Frontend Engineer at Linx, I lead the development of high-performance automotive software solutions, collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver enterprise-grade applications. Previously, at Deloitte, I spearheaded the development of automation solutions for major clients including Unilever, where I reduced development time by 25% through the implementation of Tailwind CSS and optimized cloud infrastructure costs by 20% on Google Cloud Platform. These experiences have honed my ability to deliver measurable business value while maintaining code excellence.

- **Proven ability to migrate and modernize legacy applications**, having successfully migrated 5+ Angular projects to the latest versions within Nx workspace environments at Aquasoft
- **Full-stack capabilities** with Node.js, Python/Django, and NestJS, enabling me to contribute across the entire application stack
- **Strong DevOps and cloud experience** with GCP and CI/CD optimization, reducing deployment times by 40%
- **UX/UI design background** that ensures I build not just functional, but delightful user experiences

Beyond technical skills, I bring a collaborative mindset shaped by 5+ years of remote work with international distributed teams. I thrive in agile environments, having worked extensively with SCRUM methodology, and I'm comfortable operating across North American time zones. My unique background combining Computer Engineering with Advertising and Marketing gives me a holistic perspective on software development – I understand both the technical implementation and the business impact.

I am particularly proud of my work developing a voice-controlled IoT assistant during my AI scholarship at Inatel, where I integrated natural language processing with React Native and MQTT protocols. This project exemplifies my passion for innovative solutions and my ability to work with cutting-edge technologies.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my expertise in modern web development, my commitment to code quality, and my passion for creating exceptional user experiences to **[Company Name]**. I am open to relocation or remote work arrangements and am authorized to work remotely for North American companies.
